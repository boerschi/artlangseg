\begin{abstract}
  Previous works have proposed that the `segmentability' of a language
  depends on its phonotactic structure and can be measured as the
  entropy of licit segmentations of a corpus sample. These proposals
  are tested here by generating artificial languages and measuring
  their segmentability. Maximally permissive and restrictive grammars
  (Pseudo-Berber, Pseudo-Senufo) were used to generate corpus samples 
  in which the lexical saturation and frequency distributions were
  varied parametrically. Lexical saturation tends to cause oversegmentation.
  Interestingly, better segmentation was found for flat frequency
  distributions than for the Zipfian distributions that match the
  prior assumptions of the segmenter. The results show heretofore
  unsuspected nuances of the relationship between phonotactic complexity,
  word length, and word segmentation.

itself, as Gusfield~\shortcite{Gusfield:97}.  Append lowercase letters
to the year in cases of ambiguity.  Treat double authors as
in~\cite{Aho:72}, but write as in~\cite{Chandra:81} when more than two
authors are involved. Collapse multiple citations as
in~\cite{Gusfield:97,Aho:72}.
